My task was to:

    1. Write rest-service (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) for a certain class of Lab3 using python and flask.
    2. Connect all necessary plugins.
    3. Save data in Map (java built-in interface).


To run:

    1.  Make sure you have java and maven installed and enviroment variables set.
    2.  Clone or download repo and navigate to that folder.
    3.  In cmd type "**mvn install**".
    4.  Then type "**mvn spring-boot:run**".
    5.  To check for bugs and code conventions type "**mvn site**" and open index.html in target\site.
